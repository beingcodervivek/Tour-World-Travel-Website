  <h3>The landscape of Ladhak, a high altitude desert, is defined by craggy, barren cliffs and plateaus. Ladhak is a favourite among adventure sports enthusiasts, offering unique adventures in trekking, mountaineering and white water rafting. While rafting options are available on both Indus and Zanskar rivers, the Zanskar course is more difficult and exciting. The trekking options range from short, day-long walks to visit monuments or monastic settlements to long, trans-mountain treks involving weeks of walking and camping in the wilderness. Ladhak celebrates a numbers of monastic festivals - annual events of the major monasteries primarily in winters. The month of September, hosts the Ladhak Festival, that gives a peek into the richness, depth and pageantry of Ladakh's centuries-old culture, traditions and folk heritage. One can witness the best samples of the region's performing arts, Archery contests and the Ladhak Polo Cup.
